Spin &amp; win using JavaScript

User can spin the wheel by clicking on the "SPIN" button and then the wheel starts rotating with a sound in the background which gives a perfect illusion that the wheel is rotating and making the sound.
After rotating randomly in the given time interval, wheel stops at the random position and user will get the random prize.
The moment wheel stops, a confetti effect starts on the top of the screen which celebrates the prize of the user.
